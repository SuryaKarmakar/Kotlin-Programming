```kt
fun main(){
    print("Print Function\n")
    println("Print Line Function")
}
```
Kotlin always starts in the main class or main file in the function main. This is a standard Kotlin way of running a program. when we run kotlin file, the system automatically picks out the function called main that has these parameters.

print - print function are used to display the output on console. if we used print() function then after printing the value no new line created. in this case we have to manualy add new line using \n.

println - this is print line function. its same as print but it automatically add a new line after prinitng the value on it.
